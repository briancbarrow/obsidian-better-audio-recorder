# Better Audio Recorder

 A better alternative to Obsidian's default voice recorder plugin. 
 
 Thanks to me you can finally pause and resume! 
 
 Best in every sense of the word:

- Lighter
- More efficient (pause and resume)
 
 ## Features
 
 - Basic audio recording
 - Pause audio recording (and resume)
 - Stop audio recording and save it to file (copy link to clipboard)
 - Very small code (â‰ˆ 30kb) achieved using only [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder)
 
 ## How to use it
 
 - You have a microphone icon on the left pane
 - Open Audio Recorder Interface (in the commnad palette)
